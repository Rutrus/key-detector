Use AI for key recognition for different use-cases.

## Image Recognition

The key recognition process involves storing and classifying physical keys from known locks, assigning each key a specific identifier or "keychain," for example, "House 1". This allows individual identification of each key. New keys can then be compared against these stored samples to determine their identity.

## Blockchain Traceability and Immutability

Blockchain technology will be utilized to ensure authenticity and rights of use. Each user will have a digital token proving ownership, enabling traceability. The decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain will secure the data related to key ownership and usage history.

**Disclaimer**: The goal beyond this Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to ensure that no sensitive data resides on third-party servers. The aim is to promote decentralization and data ownership, providing increased security and control for key owners.
